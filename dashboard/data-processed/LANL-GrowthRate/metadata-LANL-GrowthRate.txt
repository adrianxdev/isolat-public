    This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular intervention strategies.
    The model consists of two processes. The first process is a statistical model of how the 
    number of COVID-19 infections changes over time. The second process maps the number of 
    infections to the reported data. We model the growth of new cases as the product of a 
    dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases 
    in the population at the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting 
    susceptible population. The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of 
    the virus in that state on that date. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a 
    fraction of the newly generated cases will die and learn that fraction from observations. 
    We can also anticipate when the outbreak is likely to peak, i.e. when the daily number of new 
    confirmed cases reaches its maximum."
