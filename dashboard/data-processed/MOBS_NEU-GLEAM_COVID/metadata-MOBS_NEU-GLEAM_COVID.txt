    The GLEAM framework is based on a metapopulation approach in which the world is divided
    into geographical subpopulations. Human mobility between subpopulations is represented on a network. 
    This mobility data layer identifies the numbers of individuals traveling from one sub-population to 
    another. The mobility network is made up of different kinds of mobility processes, from short-range
    commuting between nearby subpopulations to intercontinental flights. To model short-range mobility 
    such as commuting or car travel, we rely on databases collected from the Offices of Statistics of 30 
    countries on five continents. Superimposed on the worldwide population and mobility layers is an 
    agent-based epidemic model that defines the infection and population dynamics.
