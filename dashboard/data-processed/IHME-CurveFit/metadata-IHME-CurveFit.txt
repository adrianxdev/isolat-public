    This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on the assumption 
    that current interventions continue. Non-linear mixed efects curve-fitting.

methods_long: >-
    This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on the assumption 
    that current interventions continue. The modeling approach in this study is divided into four components: 
    (i) identification and processing of COVID-19 data; 
    (ii) statistical model estimation for population death rates as a function of time 
    since the death rate exceeds a threshold in a location; 
    (iii) predicting time to exceed a given population death threshold in states early in the pandemic; and 
    (iv) modeling health service utilization as a function of deaths."
